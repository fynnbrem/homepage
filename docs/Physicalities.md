# Physical Approximations
- The calculations are applied on discrete time steps, the true path can differ, especially with many objects.
- Collisions are calculated before the object actually collides.
  - A collision is performed when the object would collide on the next tick.
  - As approximation, the objects get placed right next to each other on the moment of collision.
    - This causes extra distance covered within a single tick.
- Zero Collision Mode: The mass acting out the gravitational force is constant for every object.
  - In reality, the mass would increase linear starting from the center.
  - Even without Zero Collision Mode, you can observe this with the mouse gravity.
  - A minimal distance of 10px is enforced to prevent excessive acceleration.
- Collisions with the wall are calculated before collisions between balls one every tick.
  - This causes an unprecise position if the ball has multiple collisions within the same tick.
